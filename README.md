# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
it’s a collection of programs designed in certain procedures and techniques to perform certain functions
Software engineering is an engineering process related to developing various applications using information technology while traditional programming is not a process as such but rather writing a code to create a complete program

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 
 sdlc is a structured process of designing, developing and testing a software 

1.planning-know-how of the project you are supposed to create 
2.design-protoype how the project would look like before starting 
3.implementation-developing the actual software 
4-testing-making sure the software works with no errors 
5.deployment-realising software to consumers


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 
 waterfall model strictly adheres to rules and sdlc phases sequentially and model is used mostly on specific projects with rules 
 agile model is flexible and they rely on user’s feedback like social media platforms

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

requirement engineering is very important stage in sdlc where the software users need and demands addressed in completely 
1.feasibility study-looking the availability of resources to need carry out the project 
2.reguirement elicitation-process of knowing stakeholder needs 
3.reguirement specification-decantation in details 



Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

practice of dividing a complex software system into smaller, independent well-organized modules and this helps developers to scale different parts of application independently for efficient maintenance since it is done module by module

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1.Unit Testing: In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every module 
2.integration Testing: In this testing, two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test 
3.System Testing: In system testing, complete and integrated Software’s are tested 
4.Acceptance Testing: This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
Local Version Control-changes are tracked on a developer’s local machine. 
Centralized Version Control- A central server stores the code Distributed Version Control: Each developer has a complete copy of the repository,

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Preparing project proposals and discussing potential projects with clients and stakeholders Facilitating project initiation by defining project scope and requirements, Developing project plans and timelines to ensure the timely submission of project deliverables Managing project budgets and resources to ensure the timely completion of milestones Planning out the blueprints for software projects, including defining the scope, allocating resources, setting deadlines, laying out communication strategies, and indicating tests and maintenance Assembling and leading the project team Participating in and supervising each stage of the project

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customers Enhancements- Adding new features or improving existing ones to meet evolving user needs. Performance optimization: Improving speed, efficiency, and reliability. Porting and migration- Adapting the software to run on new hardware or software platforms. Re-engineering- Enhancing the design and architecture for better maintainability and scalability. Documentation- Creating, updating, and maintaining user manuals, technical specifications, and design documents

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

1.weak security-software fails to protect from malicious attack
2.poor data collection or sharing sensitive data 
3.misplaced priorities on designing a software 
4.algorith bias on the outcome



Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
